# Express API Project

This project was about building an API using Express and was my very first introduction to backend.

## The problem

First I decided what API the use - I used a given one, book API.

I decided to make 3 routes for this project: users, books and books3 and on top of that 2 route parameters book:id and ratings. On the rating route I decided to add some filtering, is the rating larger than or equal to the value put in by the user.

Tech & Tools used:
- RESTful API
- Postman
- JavaScript
- Node.js
